# A New Dawn

<i>"Do. Or do not. There is no try." - Yoda</i>

## Overview

I am using <b>hexagonal architecture</b> design for the "in" part, where the data from the external api flows into my api. The "out" part is very simple (it connects to the simple frontend) and doesn't need that configuration.

## How to run the project

make backend
make frontend

## How to run the backend tests

make unit

npm test
